# Emoji Everywhere

This is a project that introduces a text-based shortcut
for easily entering emoji when typing in Google
Workspace products.

With the extention installed in Chrome, focus on a text input
(such as the SUBJECT line when comping an email in Gmail) and
type ":" to bring up the emoji picker. Continue typing to filter
the list of emojis you can select.

Load this folder as an unpacked Chrome extension
(https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/)
in order to use it.
